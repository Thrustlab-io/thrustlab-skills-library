## Research-First Approach

Before asking all these questions, try to answer as many as possible from:
1. The client's website (fetch and analyze)
2. Web searches: `"{company_name}" + product`, `"{company_name}" + customers`, `"{company_name}" + competitors`
3. LinkedIn company page
4. G2/Capterra reviews (if SaaS)
5. Crunchbase (for funding, team, company size)

Then present what you found and ask the user to confirm/correct/add.

This respects the client's time and shows you've done your homework.
