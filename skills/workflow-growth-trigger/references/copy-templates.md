# Copy Templates — Growth / Hiring Surge Trigger

## Cadence Overview

Growth triggers focus on SCALING PAIN, not congratulations. Everyone congratulates growth — you understand what breaks during it.

| Step | Channel | Timing | Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Day 0 (trigger fires) | Scaling challenge specific to their growth stage |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Day 1 | Industry scaling interest |
| 3 | Email | Day 5 | Scaling playbook: "what works at [size range]" |
| 4 | Email | Day 10 | Peer story: company that scaled same transition |
| 5 | Email | Day 16 | Breakup: "before growing pains compound" |

**Growth type adjusts angle:**
- **HEADCOUNT_SURGE**: "What breaks at [X→Y] employees" — process/infrastructure focus
- **DEPARTMENT_BUILD**: "Building [function] from [X→Y]" — department-specific expertise
- **NEW_OFFICE**: "Multi-site operations" — coordination/consistency challenges
- **NEW_MARKET**: "Entering [geography/segment]" — localization/adaptation challenges

## Email 1 — Scaling Challenge (Day 0)

**Subject line formula:** `{function} at {{company_size}}-person {{company_industry}} companies`
- Reference the size stage, not the growth
- Examples: "Ops at 300-person SaaS companies" | "QA when engineering doubles"
- Subject ≤45 characters

**Structure:**
```
{{copy_opener_trigger}}

{{copy_body}}

{{copy_cta}}

{sender_signature}
```

**Total: ≤90 words**

**Hook type examples:**

**Timeline hook:**
```
Teams going from {{trigger_headcount_6mo_ago}} to {{trigger_headcount_current}} in {{company_industry}} typically hit the infrastructure wall within 3 months — and fix it in 6 weeks once they prioritize it.

The {{trigger_growth_departments}} growth at {{company_name}} is going to compound the [specific manual process] gap fast. That's usually the first thing teams at your stage address.

Happy to share the scaling timeline we've mapped for this transition.
```

**Numbers hook:**
```
At {{trigger_headcount_current}} employees, {{company_industry}} teams spend an average of [X hours/week] on [manual process] — that's 3x what it was at {{trigger_headcount_6mo_ago}}.

The math doesn't get better from here. Most teams at {{company_name}}'s stage find that [specific area] is where the inefficiency concentrates.

Want me to share the benchmarks for your size stage?
```

**Social proof hook:**
```
[Named company] was at the same inflection — grew from [X] to [Y] in {{company_industry}} and the [function] team was drowning. They [result] within [timeframe].

{{company_name}}'s {{trigger_growth_departments}} build looks like a similar trajectory.

Happy to share what worked for them.
```

**Hypothesis hook:**
```
Going from {{trigger_headcount_6mo_ago}} to {{trigger_headcount_current}} in {{company_industry}} usually means [specific challenge] — that's where most teams feel it first.

Curious whether your {{trigger_growth_departments}} team is seeing the same pattern.
```

## LinkedIn — Industry Scaling Connection (Day 1)

```
Hi {{contact_first_name}}, the {{trigger_headcount_6mo_ago}}→{{trigger_headcount_current}} transition in {{company_industry}} is one of the most interesting scaling stages. Been working with similar teams on [area] — would be great to compare notes.
```

- ≤280 characters
- Reference the SIZE TRANSITION, not "congrats on growing"

---

## Email 2 — Scaling Playbook (Day 5)

**Subject:** `{function} at {{trigger_headcount_current}}-person {{company_industry}} companies`

**Structure:**
```
{Company-based opener — not about growth}

{Value: specific benchmark, framework, or data point for their size stage}
Pattern: "We mapped what works at [size range] across {{company_industry}} teams. The biggest lever is usually [specific finding]."

{Frame as helpful content, not product pitch}

{Soft offer to share the full framework}
```

---

## Email 3 — Peer Scaling Story (Day 10)

**Subject:** `How {{peer_company}} handled the [X→Y] transition`

**Structure:**
```
{Bridge: "Similar trajectory to what we're seeing at {{company_name}}"}

{Peer story: company that scaled through the same size transition}
Format: "[Company] grew from [X] to [Y] in [timeframe]. The [specific challenge] hit hardest at [size]. They [specific solution approach], and saw [result]."

{Connection: "{{company_name}}'s [specific detail] suggests a similar pattern."}

{CTA calibrated to signal composite score}
```

---

## Email 4 — Breakup: Compounding Pains (Day 16)

**Subject:** `Before the growing pains compound`

**Structure:**
```
{Brief: one line acknowledging this is the last touch}

{Key insight: what happens if this scaling challenge goes unaddressed}
Not fearmongering — factual projection based on their growth rate.

{Open door: "If [scaling pain] becomes a priority, we're here. Happy to take a fresh look whenever."}
```

## Key Differentiation from Funding Trigger

| | Growth Trigger | Funding Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Signal | Operational strain happening NOW | Capital to invest |
| Copy DNA | "What breaks at your scale" | "Where to invest for growth" |
| Urgency source | Compounding operational pain | Growth opportunity window |
| CTA angle | Fix the bottleneck | Invest strategically |

Don't conflate them. Growth without funding is a very different dynamic — more about survival efficiency than strategic investment.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Copy focuses on scaling CHALLENGE, not congratulating growth
- [ ] Size transition language is appropriate (50→100 vs 500→1000 are different universes)
- [ ] Growth type (headcount vs department vs office) reflected in angle
- [ ] Peer stories match the same size transition
- [ ] trigger_growth_rate_pct < 20 → weaker signal, consider deprioritizing
- [ ] hook_type appropriate for growth context
- [ ] All standard copy rules (≤90 words, ≤45 char subjects, observational openers)
