# Clay Campaign Generator

This skill reads a GTM strategy file (generated by gtm-strategy-generator) and creates a Clay.com workbook with search tables based on the Clay Search Plan section.

### **Steps**

1. **Read the strategy file** provided as argument
2. **Parse the "Clay Search Plan" section** (Section 6) to extract all planned searches with their parameters
3. **Create a Clay workbook** for the client using `create_workbook` with the client name from the strategy
4. **Execute each search** defined in the plan:
   - For company searches: use `search_companies_by_industry` with the exact parameters from the plan (keywords, countries, company_sizes, annual_revenues, min/max linkedin members)
   - For geography searches: use `search_businesses_by_geography` with the exact parameters from the plan (latitude, longitude, proximity_km, business_types or query, num_results)
5. **Report results** to the user: workbook URL and each table created with record counts

### **Important**

- Use the Clay MCP tools (`mcp__clay__*`) to interact with Clay
- The workbook name should be: `[Client Name] - GTM Campaign`
- If Clay auth is not configured, prompt the user to run the clay-account-setup skill first
- Execute searches in the order of prioritization specified in the strategy
- If a search fails, report the error and continue with the remaining searches
