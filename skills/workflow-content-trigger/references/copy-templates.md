# Copy Templates — Content Engagement Trigger

## Cadence Overview

Content engagement is the WARMEST trigger — they chose to interact with your content. Tone is "continuing a conversation" not "starting one." More direct CTAs are appropriate earlier.

| Step | Channel | Timing | Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Day 0 (trigger fires) | Topic-specific follow-up + related value |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Day 1 | Connect on shared topic interest |
| 3 | Email | Day 4 | Deeper content: case study or data on same topic |
| 4 | Email | Day 8 | Bridge: content topic → underlying problem → client solution |
| 5 | Email | Day 13 | Different topic from content library |

**Engagement depth adjusts approach:**
- **DEEP** (gated download, webinar, multiple assets): Full 5-touch cadence, can be more direct
- **MODERATE** (ungated download, video watch): Standard 5-touch, slightly softer
- **LIGHT** (blog read, single like): Shorter cadence (3 touches), topic-forward only
