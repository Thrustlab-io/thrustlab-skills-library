# Real Campaign Example — Variable Usage & Scenario Architecture

Based on a live Datameister general outbound campaign. Use this as the reference pattern for how variables flow, how scenarios branch, and how copy escalates across touches.

---

## 1. Variable Architecture — Two Layers

The most important pattern: variables are generated in LAYERS, not all at once. Each layer builds on the previous.

### Layer 1: Foundation Variables (from enrichment + ICP qualification)

| Variable | Source | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| `{{firstName}}` | Apollo/LinkedIn import | Person's first name |
| `{{companyName}}` | Apollo import | Company name |
| `{{jobTitle}}` | LinkedIn enrichment | Their exact role |
| `{{industry}}` | Clay enrichment | Sector classification |
| `{{angle}}` | ICP qualification prompt | Which ICP bucket they fall into (e.g., "annotation and computer vision", "visual transformation", "constraint-aware generative design") |
| `{{language}}` | Region detection | EN or NL — determines which copy version to use |

### Layer 2: Research Variables (generated by AI prompts using Layer 1 as input)

| Variable | Generated By | What It Captures | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{{overlap_personal}}` | "Personal snippet" prompt | A HYPOTHESIS about a role-specific pain — framed as a question, not a statement | "scaling your annotation pipeline for real-time detection" |
| `{{overlap_company}}` | "Company snippet" prompt | What the company actually works on that's relevant to the client | "automated quality inspection using computer vision on the assembly line" |
| `{{company_workflow}}` | Step 2 research prompt | The specific workflow/process the company operates | "visual inspection workflows across multiple production sites" |
| `{{tech_signals}}` | Step 2 research prompt | Relevant tech they're using (from job posts, BuiltWith, public info) | "custom YOLO models for defect detection" |
| `{{company_insight}}` | Step 2 research prompt | An insightful QUESTION or observation based on research | "Curious whether you've hit the point where maintaining those models across sites becomes the bottleneck?" |
| `{{scale_trigger}}` | Step 2 research prompt | An inflection point / growth challenge hypothesis | "scaling from prototype to production-grade detection across all SKUs" |

### Layer 3: Content Matching (derived from Layer 1 `{{angle}}`)

| Variable | Generated By | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `{{blog_link}}` | Angle → content mapping table | Primary value-add content matched to their ICP bucket |
| `{{blog_link_2}}` | Angle → content mapping table | Secondary content for later in the cadence |

**KEY INSIGHT:** The `{{angle}}` variable determines which content assets are shared. Each ICP bucket has its own primary and secondary content piece. This means the blog/resource shared is always relevant to their specific pain, not a generic company resource.

### Content Matching Table Example

| Angle (ICP Bucket) | Primary Blog `{{blog_link}}` | Secondary Blog `{{blog_link_2}}` |
|---|---|---|
| annotation and computer vision | Detection Transformers article | Platform overview article |
| visual transformation & optimization | AI Automated Retopology | 3D Generative AI Reconstruction |
| constraint-aware generative design | Constraint-Aware Design article | Computational Design Symposium |

## 2. How Variables Flow Through Prompts

The prompting sequence matters. Each prompt READS the output of previous prompts:

```
Step 0: Import (firstName, companyName, jobTitle, industry)
  ↓
Step 1: ICP Qualification → {{angle}} (which bucket)
  ↓
Step 2a: Personal Snippet Prompt → {{overlap_personal}}
  Input: firstName, jobTitle, industry, angle
  Task: "Given this person is a {jobTitle} in {industry} and falls into the {angle} bucket,
         what is the most likely hands-on challenge they face?"
  Output: A specific, hypothesis-framed pain (not generic)
  ↓
Step 2b: Company Snippet Prompt → {{overlap_company}}
  Input: companyName, industry, angle, + Claygent web research
  Task: "What does {companyName} actually do that relates to {angle}?"
  Output: Specific company-level context
  ↓
Step 3: Deep Research Prompt → {{company_workflow}}, {{tech_signals}}, {{company_insight}}, {{scale_trigger}}
  Input: All of the above + deeper Claygent research
  Task: "Research {companyName}'s operations. What workflows do they run?
         What tech are they using? What's the insightful hypothesis question?
         What's their likely scaling challenge?"
  Output: Four separate, specific variables
  ↓
Step 4: Content Matching → {{blog_link}}, {{blog_link_2}}
  Input: {{angle}}
  Task: Lookup table mapping angle → content URLs
  ↓
Step 5: Language Detection → {{language}}
  Input: company location, contact location
  Output: "EN" or "NL"
```

**CRITICAL:** Each step produces variables that the COPY uses. The copy itself doesn't do the thinking — the research prompts do. Copy just ASSEMBLES pre-researched variables.

## 3. Scenario Branching — Adapt Based on Response

General outbound isn't one linear cadence. It branches based on what happens:

### Scenario Decision Tree

```
Day 0: LinkedIn Invite sent
  │
  ├── SCENARIO 1: Has email + LI accepted within 10 days
  │   Day 0:  LinkedIn Invite
  │   Day 2:  LI Message 1 (question + blog 1)
  │   Day 5:  Email 1 (reinforce + introduce)
  │   Day 12: LI Message 2 (deep research + insight + blog 2)
  │   Day 46: LI Message 3 (soft close)
  │
  ├── SCENARIO 2: Has email + LI NOT accepted initially + Email sent + LI accepted later
  │   Day 0:  LinkedIn Invite
  │   Day 10: Email 1 (with PS about LI invite + blog 1)
  │   Day 11: LI accepted → LI Message 1
  │   Day 16: Email 2 (deep research)
  │   Day 48: LI Message 2 (soft close + blog 2)
  │
  ├── SCENARIO 3: Has email + LI never accepted
  │   Day 0:  LinkedIn Invite
  │   Day 10: Email 1 (with PS about invite + blog 1)
  │   Day 17: Email 2 (deep research)
  │   Day 51: Email 3 (soft close + blog 2)
  │
  └── SCENARIO 4: No email, LinkedIn only
      Day 0:  LinkedIn Invite
      Wait until accepted (no time limit)
      Day +2:  LI Message 1 (question + blog 1)
      Day +12: LI Message 2 (deep research + blog 2)
      Day +44: LI Message 3 (soft close)
```

**KEY INSIGHT:** The channel mix changes based on what's available and what the prospect does. This is more realistic than a fixed "Day 0, Day 3, Day 7" cadence.

## 4. Copy Escalation Pattern

The copy escalates through distinct phases. Each phase uses different variables:

### Phase 1: Opening (LI Invite / first touch)
**Variables used:** `{{firstName}}`, `{{companyName}}`, `{{industry}}`, `{{overlap_company}}`
**Tone:** Peer curiosity — "came across your work, want to connect"
**Goal:** Get the connection, NOT sell

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Question (LI Message 1 / Email 1)
**Variables used:** `{{overlap_personal}}`, `{{overlap_company}}`, `{{blog_link}}`
**Tone:** "Would I be right in thinking [hypothesis] is something your team is dealing with?"
**Goal:** Validate the pain hypothesis + deliver value (blog)

### Phase 3: Deep Research (LI Message 2 / Email 2)
**Variables used:** `{{company_workflow}}`, `{{tech_signals}}`, `{{company_insight}}`, `{{scale_trigger}}`, `{{blog_link_2}}`
**Tone:** "Spent some time looking at how [company] handles [workflow]..."
**Goal:** Demonstrate genuine research + ask insightful question

### Phase 4: Soft Close (LI Message 3 / Email 3)
**Variables used:** `{{overlap_personal}}`, `{{companyName}}`
**Tone:** "If [topic] comes up, our door is always open."
**Goal:** Leave the door open, no pressure. Reference LinkedIn page for ongoing nurture.

**KEY INSIGHT:** Copy doesn't pitch harder over time — it goes DEEPER on research, then SOFTER on close. The sequence is: light → hypothesis → deep research → soft close.

## 5. A/B Version Strategy

Every touch point has two versions. They're not just tone variations — they test different APPROACHES:

| Version A | Version B |
|---|---|
| Leads with a **question** about their pain | Leads with an **observation** about their company |
| `"Would I be right in thinking {{overlap_personal}}?"` | `"Given {{companyName}}'s work in {{overlap_company}}..."` |
| Person-focused (their challenge) | Company-focused (their work) |

This maps to the two opener types already in the skill system: `copy_opener_company` (Version B) and a hypothesis-based opener (Version A).

---

## 6. Multi-Language Pattern

Every message exists in EN and NL. The `{{language}}` variable (from region detection) determines which version is sent.

**Implications for the skill system:**
- Copy generation prompts should include a language instruction: "Generate in {{language}}"
- Or: generate English first, then include a translation step for applicable languages
- Client profile should specify: target languages and which regions map to which language
- Some clients may need: EN, NL, FR, DE depending on geography

## 7. Industry Proof Points Matching

Proof points are pre-mapped per industry, not generated per lead:

| Industry | Proof Point | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Automotive/Aerospace | Design cycle: 18→8 months, €5M saved | Named case study |
| Gaming/VFX | 70% time on cleanup → automated | Named case study |
| Manufacturing | 60% cycle reduction | General pattern |

**Implication:** The `icp-mapping.md` industry pain mapping should include proof points per vertical. The copy prompts then SELECT the right proof point based on `{{industry}}`.

## 8. Patterns to Carry Forward Into All Campaigns

1. **Hypothesis framing** — "Would I be right in thinking..." is more engaging than "I noticed you struggle with..."
2. **Research demonstration** — "Spent some time looking at how {{companyName}} handles {{company_workflow}}" proves you've done homework
3. **Content as value currency** — every early touch includes a relevant blog/resource, matched to their angle
4. **Soft close, not hard close** — "Our door is always open" + "extra pair of expert eyes" is non-threatening
5. **PS lines do heavy lifting** — PS is where the secondary CTA or LinkedIn cross-reference lives
6. **LinkedIn company page as nurture** — the breakup message routes them to ongoing content, keeping the relationship alive even if they don't respond
7. **Variables do the personalization, copy does the framing** — the copy templates are relatively standard; the VARIABLES make each email feel unique
