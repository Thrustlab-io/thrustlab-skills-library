# Copy Templates — Compliance / Regulatory Trigger

## Cadence Overview

Compliance triggers have BUILT-IN urgency from real deadlines — don't manufacture extra. Position as authority and ally, not fearmongerer.

| Step | Channel | Timing | Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Day 0 (trigger fires) | Regulation observation + how it affects their specific business |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Day 2 | Connect on regulatory topic in their industry |
| 3 | Email | Day 5 | Compliance checklist / readiness framework (pure value) |
| 4 | Email | Day 10 | Social proof: peer company compliance success story |
| 5 | Email | Day 15 | Deadline reminder + offer (if deadline <3 months) |

**Deadline proximity adjusts cadence intensity:**
- **>6 months:** Educational, longer spacing (Day 0, 5, 12, 20)
- **3-6 months:** Planning urgency, standard spacing
- **<3 months:** Active urgency, tighter spacing (Day 0, 3, 7, 12, 15)
- **Past deadline:** Remediation angle, different copy DNA entirely

## Email 1 — Regulation Observation (Day 0)

**Subject line formula:** `{{trigger_regulation_name}} + {{company_industry}}`
- Reference the regulation, not {client_name}
- Examples: "NIS2 readiness for fintech teams" | "DORA compliance before July"
- Subject ≤45 characters

**Structure:**
```
{{copy_opener_trigger}}

{{copy_body}}

{{copy_cta}}

{sender_signature}
```

**Total: ≤90 words**

**Hook type examples:**

**Timeline hook:**
```
Fintech teams typically achieve full NIS2 compliance in 8 weeks — even starting from zero documentation.

The trickiest part for companies at {{company_name}}'s stage is usually the incident reporting framework. That's where most of the manual effort concentrates.

Happy to share the 8-week compliance roadmap we've mapped out — might save your team some audit cycles.
```

**Numbers hook:**
```
Teams using automated compliance workflows cut {{trigger_regulation_name}} audit prep time by 70% — that's roughly 200 hours back per quarter.

For {{company_industry}} companies at {{company_name}}'s scale, the gap between manual and automated compliance is the difference between a full-time hire and a Tuesday afternoon.

Want me to send the breakdown?
```

**Social proof hook:**
```
[Named company] achieved full {{trigger_regulation_name}} compliance 6 weeks before deadline — after initially being flagged as high-risk in their preliminary assessment.

Their situation looked a lot like {{company_name}}'s: {{company_industry}}, similar scale, same regulatory exposure.

Happy to share what their compliance path looked like if useful.
```

**Hypothesis hook (deadline <3 months):**
```
{{trigger_regulation_name}}'s {{trigger_regulation_deadline}} deadline is creating real pressure on {{company_industry}} operations teams.

The [specific requirement] is where most companies underestimate the effort — especially the [specific technical/process requirement] piece.

We've been helping {{company_industry}} teams streamline that exact workflow. Worth comparing notes?
