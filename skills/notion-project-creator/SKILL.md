# Notion Project Creator Skill

You are helping create a complete Notion workspace for a new GTM client by replicating the proven GTM Client Hub Template structure. This skill reads an existing GTM strategy markdown file (generated by gtm-strategy-generator), extracts client information, creates the workspace structure, and populates the GTM Strategy page with the content.

## Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: This skill expects that a GTM strategy has already been generated using the gtm-strategy-generator skill. The strategy markdown file should exist at `strategies/[CLIENT_NAME].md`.

## Required Information

The skill takes one argument:
1. **Client name or strategy file path** - Either the client name (will look for `strategies/[CLIENT_NAME].md`) or the full path to the strategy markdown file

The skill will then:
1. Read the strategy markdown file
2. Extract client information from the strategy:
   - Client name (from filename or document)
   - Client website (from "Company Snapshot" or similar section)
   - Product/service description
   - Value proposition
3. Use this information to create the Notion workspace
4. Copy the strategy content to the GTM Strategy page

## Workspace Structure to Create

The skill will replicate the structure from the GTM Client Hub Template, creating the following hierarchy:

### 1. Main Client Hub Page

Create a parent page titled: `🎯 [Client Name] - GTM Client Hub`

This page should include:

#### Braindump & Quick Notes
A callout (gray background, 💡 icon) with checkboxes:
- [ ] Key observation or idea to discuss
- [ ] Research item to follow up on
- [ ] Strategic question to explore

#### To Discuss with Client
A callout (gray background, 💡 icon) with checkboxes:
- [ ] ICP refinement and target market validation
- [ ] Next campaign priorities and focus areas
- [ ] Performance metrics and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Budget allocation and resource planning

#### Documentation Hub
A collapsible callout with links to all core documentation pages (created in step 2)

     ✅ Notion workspace created successfully!

     📍 Main Hub: https://www.notion.so/[page-id]
     📄 Strategy copied from: strategies/Acme_Corp.md

     Created pages:
     • GTM Strategy - Acme Corp
     • Competitor Analysis - Acme Corp
     • GTM General Information
     • Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
     • Phase 2: Market Research
     • Phase 3: Outbound Workflows
     ... (and 8 more pages)
     ```

## Notion-Specific Instructions

### Page Creation Order
1. First create all sub-pages (A through N)
2. Then create the main hub page with links to all sub-pages

### Capturing Page URLs

**IMPORTANT**: When creating pages with the Notion MCP tools, the response includes the page URL.

1. **After creating the main hub page**, the `notion-create-pages` tool returns a response containing:
   - Page ID
   - Page URL (in format: `https://www.notion.so/[page-id]`)

2. **Save the main hub URL** from the create response

3. **Example response structure**:
```json
{
  "results": [{
    "id": "fb1533a2-0746-4e9e-8167-e5c8c6800385",
    "url": "https://www.notion.so/fb1533a207464e9e8167e5c8c6800385"
  }]
}
```

4. **Extract and display** the URL from the main hub page creation response

5. **At completion**, provide the user with:
   - Direct link to the main hub: `https://www.notion.so/[page-id]`
   - Formatted message: "✅ Notion workspace created: [Client Name] - GTM Client Hub"
   - Clickable URL for easy access

### Formatting Guidelines
- Use callouts for highlighted sections (Braindump, To Discuss)
- Use emoji icons consistently for each page type
- Use toggle lists (▶) for the Documentation Hub section
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for main titles, ## for sections)
- Include empty blocks between major sections for spacing

### Content Placeholders
When client information is provided:
- Replace `[Client Name]` with actual client name
- Replace `[Client Website]` with actual URL
- Replace `[Project Start Date]` with actual date or today's date
- Leave other bracketed items as placeholders for future population

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use the exact structure from the template to ensure all clients have the same foundation
- **Visual clarity**: Use emoji icons to make pages easily identifiable
- **Scalability**: Structure allows for easy expansion and customization per client
- **Documentation**: Each section includes helpful hints about what content belongs there
- **Actionable**: Include checklists and templates that can be immediately used
- **URL Tracking**: Always capture and display the main hub page URL from the Notion API response - this is the primary deliverable for the user

## Strategy File Parsing

The skill must extract client information from the GTM strategy markdown file to populate the Notion workspace.

### Expected Strategy File Location:
- Default path: `strategies/[CLIENT_NAME].md`
- Or user-provided full path

### Information to Extract:

Look for these sections in the strategy file (typically in the first section):

1. **Company Snapshot / Company Overview:**
   - Client name (e.g., "Client Name: Acme Corp")
   - Website URL (e.g., "Website: https://acme.com")
   - Product/Service description
   - Value proposition
   - Primary use cases

2. **Market Information:**
   - Primary geography
   - Primary industries
   - Target personas/titles

3. **Additional Context:**
   - Average deal size/ACV
   - Sales motion (SaaS/Services/Hybrid)

### Parsing Strategy:

```markdown
1. Read the entire markdown file
2. Look for patterns like:
   - "Client Name:" or "Company:" followed by the name
   - "Website:" or "URL:" followed by the URL
   - First H1 heading may contain company name
3. Extract all relevant information
4. Use extracted info to populate Notion workspace placeholders
5. Copy the entire strategy content to the GTM Strategy Notion page
```

### Fallback Behavior:

If information cannot be extracted:
- Use the filename (CLIENT_NAME from strategies/CLIENT_NAME.md)
- Ask user to confirm or provide missing information
- Proceed with placeholders for any missing data

## After Setup

Ask the user if they want to:
- Review and customize any sections for this specific client
- Add additional pages or sections beyond the template
- Set up linked databases (Projects, Roadmap)
- Share the workspace with specific team members
- Make any adjustments to the populated strategy content

## Error Handling

### Strategy File Not Found:
- Check if file exists at `strategies/[CLIENT_NAME].md`
- Try variations of the client name (with/without spaces, underscores vs hyphens)
- Ask user to provide the correct file path or client name
- Suggest running `/gtm-strategy-generator [website]` first if strategy doesn't exist
- Do NOT proceed with workspace creation if strategy file cannot be found

### Strategy File Parsing Errors:
- If client information cannot be extracted, ask user to provide it manually
- Use filename as fallback for client name
- Proceed with best-effort information extraction

### Notion API Errors:
- Check authentication status (`/mcp` command)
- Verify permissions to create pages
- Provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
- Offer to retry or create pages manually

## Success Criteria

The skill has succeeded when:
✅ Strategy markdown file is successfully located and read
✅ Client information is extracted from the strategy file
✅ Main hub page is created with all sections
✅ All 14 core documentation pages are created as sub-pages
✅ GTM Strategy page is populated with the full strategy content from the markdown file
✅ Documentation Hub contains working links to all pages
✅ Client-specific information is properly populated throughout
✅ User receives the main hub page URL
✅ Structure matches the GTM Client Hub Template

## Notes

- **PREREQUISITE**: This skill requires an existing GTM strategy markdown file generated by gtm-strategy-generator
- **Workflow order**:
  1. First: `/gtm-strategy-generator [client-website]` creates `strategies/[CLIENT_NAME].md`
  2. Then: `/notion-project-creator [client-name]` reads the file and creates Notion workspace
- The skill automatically extracts client information from the strategy file, eliminating manual data entry
- Strategy content is automatically copied to the GTM Strategy Notion page during workspace creation
- This creates a dual-source setup: markdown file for version control, Notion page for client collaboration
- The structure is standardized but can be customized after creation
- Works best when Notion MCP server is already authenticated
- All pages are created under the user's default workspace unless specified otherwise
- If the strategy file cannot be found, the skill will prompt for the correct path or client name
