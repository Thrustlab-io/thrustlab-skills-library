# Copy Templates — Tech Stack Change Trigger

## Cadence Overview

Tech stack changes signal active evaluation. Copy demonstrates ecosystem intelligence — you understand how tools fit together, not just your own product.

| Step | Channel | Timing | Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email | Day 0 (trigger fires) | Stack observation + ecosystem positioning |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Day 1 | Tech/industry interest connection |
| 3 | Email | Day 5 | Integration guide / migration framework (type-dependent) |
| 4 | Email | Day 10 | Social proof: company with same stack that added client |
| 5 | Email | Day 15 | Breakup: technical angle with different value prop |

**Change type drives the entire cadence approach:**
- **COMPLEMENTARY_ADD**: "Completes the stack" — integration and combined value
- **COMPETITOR_REMOVED**: "Evaluating alternatives" — differentiation on merits, zero competitor bashing
- **STACK_SHIFT**: "Modernization journey" — strategic architecture perspective
- **COMPETITOR_ADDED**: → Auto-DQ or route to separate long-term nurture
- **IRRELEVANT**: → Stop

## Email 1 — Stack Observation (Day 0)

**Subject line formula:** `{product_category} + {{trigger_tech_added}}` or `{function} stack in {{company_industry}}`
- Reference the category, not the specific tool gossip
- Examples: "Data stack evolution at {{company_name}}" | "Getting more from {{trigger_tech_added}}"
- Subject ≤45 characters

**Structure:**
```
{{copy_opener_trigger}}

{{copy_body}}

{{copy_cta}}

{sender_signature}
```

**Total: ≤90 words**

**Hook type examples by change type:**

**COMPLEMENTARY_ADD — Timeline hook:**
```
Teams adding {{trigger_tech_added}} to their stack typically see the biggest impact within 4 weeks when they connect it to [client's area].

The integration between {{trigger_tech_added}} and [client product category] is where {{company_industry}} teams are seeing compounding gains — especially at {{company_name}}'s scale.

Want me to send the integration playbook?
```

**COMPLEMENTARY_ADD — Numbers hook:**
```
{{company_industry}} teams running {{trigger_tech_added}} alongside [client product category] see 50% more throughput than either tool alone.

At {{company_name}}'s scale, that gap is probably [X hours/dollars] per month. The integration is usually the easy part.

Happy to share the benchmarks.
```

**COMPETITOR_REMOVED — Social proof hook:**
```
[Named company] made a similar move — evolved their [category] stack last quarter. They evaluated several alternatives and landed on an approach that [specific result].

Their {{company_industry}} setup was similar to {{company_name}}'s. Happy to share what mattered most in their evaluation.
```

**COMPETITOR_REMOVED — Hypothesis hook:**
```
When {{company_industry}} teams evolve their [category] stack, the priorities usually shift to [what client does better] — that's where most evaluation frameworks start.

Curious what's driving the change at {{company_name}}.
```

**STACK_SHIFT — Timeline hook:**
```
Teams modernizing their [function] stack typically get to full production in [timeframe] when they sequence it right — [first step] first, then [second step].

{{company_name}}'s restructuring looks like it's heading in a similar direction.

Want me to share the migration timeline we've mapped?
```

## LinkedIn — Tech/Industry Connection (Day 1)

```
Hi {{contact_first_name}}, noticed {{company_name}} is evolving the [function] stack. Been working with {{company_industry}} teams on how [client area] fits into modern [function] architecture — would love to compare notes.
```

- ≤280 characters
- Tech ecosystem perspective, not product pitch
- Reference the CATEGORY evolution, not specific tool gossip

## Email 2 — Type-Specific Value (Day 5)

**COMPLEMENTARY_ADD:**
- Subject: `Getting more from {{trigger_tech_added}} + {client_product_category}`
- Value: integration benefits, combined workflow, efficiency gain
- Pattern: "Here's how teams pair [added tool] with [client area] for [specific outcome]"

**COMPETITOR_REMOVED:**
- Subject: `What to look for in a {product_category} in {year}`
- Value: evaluation framework that positions client strengths without naming competitors
- Pattern: "When evaluating [category], the criteria that matter most for {{company_industry}} are..."

**STACK_SHIFT:**
- Subject: `Rebuilding {function} infrastructure in {{company_industry}}`
- Value: best practices for tech consolidation in their vertical
- Pattern: "The most successful stack modernizations we've seen in {{company_industry}} follow [approach]"

---

## Email 3 — Peer Stack Story (Day 10)

**Subject:** `How {{peer_company}} rebuilt their {function} stack`

**Structure:**
```
{Company-based opener — not about the tool change}

{Peer story: company with same stack profile that added {client_name}}
Match the change type:
- COMPLEMENTARY: "[Company] added {client product} to complement their [tool] stack and saw [result]"
- COMPETITOR_REMOVED: "[Company] evaluated several [category] options and chose based on [differentiator]"
- STACK_SHIFT: "[Company] rebuilt their entire [function] architecture in [timeframe] — started with [first step]"

{Bridge to {{company_name}}'s situation}

{CTA calibrated to signal composite}
```

---

## Email 4 — Technical Breakup (Day 15)

**Subject:** `Different angle on {function} at {{company_name}}`

**Structure:**
```
{Acknowledge this is a different approach}

{Technical value: share a different capability or value prop than Email 1}
Show breadth — maybe the first angle didn't resonate, but this one might.

{Open door: "If the stack evolution brings up [new challenge], happy to jam on it."}
```

## Auto-DQ Rules

| Change Type | Action |
|---|---|
| COMPETITOR_ADDED | Route to long-term nurture (6-12 month), not active cadence |
| IRRELEVANT | Stop — no outreach |
| COMPLEMENTARY/REMOVED/SHIFT | Full cadence |
