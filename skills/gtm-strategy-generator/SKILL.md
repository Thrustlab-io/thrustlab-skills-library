# General
Put your output as a single md file in strategies/CLIENT_NAME.md
### **Research Protocol**

1. **Always start with web_fetch on client website** for primary intelligence
2. **Follow with 3-5 targeted web_search queries** using:
    - `"[company]" + industry terms + geography`
    - `"[competitor names]" + regulatory/compliance terms`
    - `"[market segment]" + local market qualifiers`
3. **Never use generic searches** - always include industry-specific terminology
4. **Document everything** with [Source: URL] citations

### **Strategy Architecture Requirements**

Generate exactly **13 core sections + 2 appendices** in this order:

### **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Sections 1-3)**

1. **Company Snapshot** - One page max, bullet format
2. **ICP & Buying Personas** - Include disqualifiers and anti-patterns
3. **Marketing Ecosystem Integration** - Bridge outbound insights to existing marketing

### **Phase 2: Market Mapping (Sections 4-5)**

1. **TAM → SAM Filtering** - Provide exact [Clay.com](http://clay.com/) enrichment fields
2. **List-Building Mechanics** - Concrete boolean strings, not theory

### **Phase 3: Messaging & Personalization (Sections 6-9)**

1. **Messaging Architecture** - Map pains → outcomes → proof 1:1
2. **Scalable Personalization Framework** - 3 effort tiers with time allocations
3. **Outbound Cadences** - 2 complete variants, 10 business days max
4. **Top 6 Observational Openers** - Based on actual research, not templates

### **Phase 4: Advanced Systems (Sections 10-13)**

1. **Trigger Playbook** - Minimum 10 triggers across 3 tiers:
    - Tier 1: Direct intent (tech migrations, compliance deadlines)
    - Tier 2: Behavioral (content consumption, peer activity)
    - Tier 3: Environmental (market dynamics, growth indicators)
2. **GTM Flywheel** - Focus on compound effects:
    - Network amplification strategies
    - Data accumulation loops
    - Revenue expansion mechanics
3. **Playbooks & Enablement** - 3-minute research checklist, call scripts
4. **The Thrustlab 90-Day GTM Machine Blueprint** - Use EXACT structure below:

6. Compound combinations (e.g., "new VP Sales" + "competitor churn")

### **Quality Checkpoints**

Before delivering:

- ✓ Every recommendation tied to source material
- ✓ Zero generic value props - all industry/role specific
- ✓ Executable within 48 hours
- ✓ Systems that improve autonomously
- ✓ Clear ownership assignments
- ✓ Measurable success metrics

### **Output Constraints**

- **No fluff phrases:** "leverage," "synergy," "revolutionary"
- **No long paragraphs:** Max 3 sentences per bullet
- **No theory without practice:** Every concept needs execution steps

**Remember:** You're building a GTM machine that runs 24/7, not a one-time campaign. Every element should contribute to a system that gets smarter, faster, and more efficient with each interaction.
