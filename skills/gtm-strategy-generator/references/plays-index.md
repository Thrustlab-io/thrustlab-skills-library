# Plays Index

This is the master list of all available outbound workflow plays. Each play represents a complete Clay workflow that can be deployed for clients.

## Tier 1: Highest-Converting Plays (Warm Signals)

### Champion Tracking
**Name:** Champion Tracking
**Description:** Monitors when past customers, engaged prospects, or known contacts change jobs, then generates outreach leveraging the existing relationship. The #1 highest-converting signal type. Former customers convert at dramatically higher rates because trust and product knowledge already exist. Combined with funding or hiring signals, this becomes the highest-converting stack in outbound.

### Content Trigger
**Name:** Content Trigger
**Description:** Captures engagement with content (downloads, webinar attendance, social engagement, podcast listens). The warmest trigger type. The prospect already engaged with the client's content, making outreach feel like a natural next step rather than cold outreach.

### Website Trigger
**Name:** Website Trigger
**Description:** Captures website visitors and infers intent from page behavior. Copy angle is recency and intent-based — the prospect was JUST looking at the client's solution. Never feels creepy, always insightful.

### Competitor Customer
**Name:** Competitor Customer
**Description:** Identifies companies using competitor products and generates competitive displacement outreach. 2.5x higher conversion when targeting competitor users, 3x when mentioning an existing customer who switched. These prospects already understand the problem space.

## Tier 2: High-Intent Timing Signals

### Funding Trigger
**Name:** Funding Trigger
**Description:** Captures funding announcements and targets companies based on growth momentum. The funding announcement reveals where they're investing (hiring, product, expansion). Timing is critical (first 2-4 weeks post-announcement).

### Job Change Trigger
**Name:** Job Change Trigger
**Description:** Targets personas who just started a new role. The "new broom" window — they're evaluating everything and eager to make an impact in the first 90 days. Warm, congratulatory approach.

### Job Posting Trigger
**Name:** Job Posting Trigger
**Description:** Monitors job postings for roles that indicate a gap the client's product fills. Hiring reveals pain. The job description lists the exact responsibilities, tools, and challenges the company faces.

### Compliance Trigger
**Name:** Compliance Trigger
**Description:** Targets companies affected by regulatory deadlines, new laws, or policy changes. The strongest urgency of any trigger type — the company MUST act due to external mandate, not just should. Highly vertical-specific.

## Tier 3: Operational & Stack Signals

### Growth Trigger
**Name:** Growth Trigger
**Description:** Monitors headcount growth (>20% in a quarter), new office openings, or market expansion. Rapid growth creates operational strain that breaks existing processes. Copy connects scaling pain to the client's solution.

### Tech Change Trigger
**Name:** Tech Change Trigger
**Description:** Captures technology adoption or removal. Stack evolution signals — adding a complementary tool creates integration opportunity, removing a competitor opens replacement window.

### Dark Funnel
**Name:** Dark Funnel
**Description:** Captures anonymous buying signals from LinkedIn engagement, community activity, and website visits beyond basic page views. Illuminates the 70%+ of B2B buyer journey that happens invisibly. Copy uses signals for timing and angle selection without surveillance creep.

## Universal Play (Always Active)

### General Outbound
**Name:** General Outbound
**Description:** Proactive outreach to ICP-fit accounts without a specific trigger event. The hardest workflow to make effective. Research depth is the only hook — the email must earn attention purely through relevance and insight since there's no timing signal.
