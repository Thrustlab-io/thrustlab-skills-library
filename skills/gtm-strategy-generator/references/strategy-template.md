### Company Snapshot
One page max. Bullet format.
- What they sell, to whom, and why it matters
- Current traction: ARR, customer count, notable logos (if known)
- Market position: leader / challenger / niche player
- Key insight: What makes their outbound motion unique or challenging?
- Source all claims: `[Source: URL]`

### ICP & Buying Personas
For each persona (primary, secondary, tertiary):
- Title variations (all titles that map to this persona)
- Department and reporting line
- Daily responsibilities and KPIs they're measured on
- Primary pain: the specific problem the client solves for them
- Secondary pains: adjacent challenges
- How they buy: research process, internal champions, blockers
- **Disqualifiers:** What makes a company/person NOT a fit (anti-patterns)
- **Buying triggers:** What events make them actively search for a solution

### Available Plays — Menu

These are the outbound workflows available to clients. Select exactly 3 that best fit the client's ICP, sales motion, and available data sources.

#### Tier 1: Highest-Converting Plays (Warm Signals)

**Champion Tracking** — The #1 highest-converting signal type
Monitors when past customers, engaged prospects, or known contacts change jobs, then generates outreach leveraging the existing relationship. Copy DNA: Trust and shared history. Former customers convert at dramatically higher rates because trust and product knowledge already exist. Combined with funding or hiring signals, this becomes the highest-converting stack in outbound.
*Required:* CRM contact list, UserGems or Clay job change detection

**Content Trigger** — The warmest trigger type
Captures engagement with content (downloads, webinar attendance, social engagement, podcast listens). Copy DNA: Demonstrated interest. The prospect already engaged with the client's content, making outreach feel like a natural next step rather than cold outreach.
*Required:* Content assets (blog, whitepapers, webinars), HubSpot/Marketo or LinkedIn Analytics

**Website Trigger** — Recency + inferred intent
Captures website visitors and infers intent from page behavior. Copy DNA: The prospect was JUST looking at the client's solution. Never feels creepy ("I saw you on our site"), always insightful ("teams exploring [area] usually...").
*Required:* Intent tool (RB2B, Clearbit, 6sense, Dealfront)

**Competitor Customer** — 2.5x higher conversion
Identifies companies using competitor products and generates competitive displacement outreach. Copy DNA: Competitive intelligence. These prospects already understand the problem space — they're actively paying for a solution. Data shows 3x conversion when mentioning an existing customer who switched.
*Required:* Competitor list, BuiltWith/G2 data, case study of customer who switched

#### Tier 2: High-Intent Timing Signals

**Funding Trigger** — Growth momentum
Captures funding announcements. Copy DNA: Investment thesis alignment. The funding announcement reveals WHERE they're investing (hiring, product, expansion). Connect the client's solution to stated growth priorities, NOT just "congrats on the raise." Timing is critical (first 2-4 weeks post-announcement).
*Required:* Funding data source (Crunchbase, PitchBook)

**Job Change Trigger** — The "new broom" window
Targets personas who just started a new role. Copy DNA: Transition momentum. They're in "new broom" mode, evaluating everything, eager to make an impact in the first 90 days. Warm, congratulatory, never presumptuous.
*Required:* Job change signal (UserGems, Clay, LinkedIn Sales Nav alerts)

**Job Posting Trigger** — Hiring reveals pain
Monitors job postings for roles that indicate a gap the client's product fills. Copy DNA: The job description is a goldmine — it lists the exact responsibilities, tools, and challenges. Copy connects the hiring need to the client's solution, positioning it as a force multiplier for the new hire.
*Required:* Job posting data (Clay, Otta, LinkedIn Jobs)

**Compliance Trigger** — Strongest urgency of any trigger type
Targets companies affected by regulatory deadlines, new laws, or policy changes. Copy DNA: External mandate urgency. Unlike other triggers where the company chooses to act, compliance triggers mean they MUST act — there's a deadline, a fine, or a legal requirement. Highly vertical-specific.
*Required:* Deep vertical knowledge, specific regulatory mapping

#### Tier 3: Operational & Stack Signals

**Growth Trigger** — Scaling pain
Monitors headcount growth (>20% in a quarter), new office openings, or market expansion. Copy DNA: When a company grows rapidly, existing processes break. What worked for 50 people doesn't work for 100. Copy connects this scaling pain to the client's solution, framing it as infrastructure for the next stage.
*Required:* Headcount tracking data (LinkedIn, Crunchbase)

**Tech Change Trigger** — Stack evolution
Captures technology adoption or removal. Copy DNA: Adding a complementary tool = integration opportunity. Removing a competitor = active replacement window. Shows you understand their tech ecosystem, not just one tool.
*Required:* BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, tech stack tracking

**Dark Funnel** — Captures 70%+ of buyer journey
Captures anonymous buying signals from LinkedIn engagement (Teamfluence/Trigify), community activity (Common Room), and website visits beyond basic page views. Copy DNA: Relevance without surveillance. Use the signal for TIMING and ANGLE selection, never reference the specific signal directly.
*Required:* Dark funnel tooling (Teamfluence, Trigify, Common Room, Dealfront)

#### Universal Play (Always Active)

**General Outbound** — The hardest workflow to make effective
Proactive outreach to ICP-fit accounts WITHOUT a specific trigger event. Copy DNA: Research depth as the hook. Since there's no timing signal, the email must earn attention purely through relevance and insight. Every email must pass the "would a human SDR write this after 15 minutes of research?" test.
*Required:* Strong ICP definition, persona × vertical matrix
