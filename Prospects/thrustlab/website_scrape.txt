Timeline
1
Step 1
Learn and research your ideal customer.

You fill out our onboarding questionnaire to help us learn about your ICP. We conduct additional research to gain insights into your targets' motivations and pain points.

The goal? Putting the right message in front of the right person.
2
Step 2
Set up your email-sending infrastructure and research your target audience.

We set up multiple domains & mailboxes, configure technical records and start warming them up.

The goal? Ensuring your emails land outside of SPAM.
3
Step 3
Craft your email sequences and build your lead lists.

We write messaging angles for your different customer profiles. We build contextual lead lists by looking at buying signals (e.g: surge in hiring, ad spend, opening of new offices, acquisition) and industry trends.

The goal? Reaching the right company at the right time.

Step 4
Send personalized messages at scale.
