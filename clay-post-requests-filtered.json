Our system of AI-powered assessments is based on objective factors that are scientifically proven to predict high performance (e.g. cognitive aptitude).\n\n𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏𝐅𝐔𝐋 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒:\n Reviews from people we've hired:   crossover.com/reviews\n Current openings:   crossover.com/jobs\n Hire someone for your company:   crossover.com/hire\n How the process works:   crossover.com/selection-process\n FAQs:   crossover.com/help\n~~~\n𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.\n\nAllow us to clarify some common misconceptions:\n1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.\n2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).\n3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.\n\nIt's hard, but it's worth it!",

BlueGround has 45 years of experience and understands the importance of accessibility for its clients. The name change to BlueGround is also associated with the company’s future strategic expansion towards services for businesses: the establishment of independent activities or companies; financial growth and investment; liquidations, divestments, mergers and acquisitions as well as shareholder support.\n\nThe new name BlueGround refers to the rock layer where diamonds are found. We’re still leaving diamond mining up to another sector - but the symbolism is clear. We dig ever deeper into our clients’ numbers in search of concrete optimisation possibilities. We are only satisfied when our advice helps our clients save and increase their profit margins.\n\nWith a 50 strong team, BlueGround is the solid accountancy foundation that companies can rely on, helping them focus purely on their core businesses.
